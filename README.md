# COOKIE-CLICKER-GAME
A very popular version of this type of game is ‘Cookie Clicker’, which you can see here: http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/
Your task is to create a simple incremental game of your own. It will take the form of one large button – each click of this button will award the player with a point. Your game should show you how many points the player has earned this way.
You will also need to provide a ‘shop’ from which players can buy upgrades. These will increase the number of points gained by clicks, or give some ‘passive’ point generation.
Each time an upgrade is purchased, the cost goes up. The two types of upgrade you must provide are:
1. Click Enhancement, which increases the number of points gained per click by one for each time the upgrade has been purchased.
2. Passive Click Generation, which generates X point(s) per Y second(s), every time the upgrade has been purchased.

When the player has gained 20 points, they can buy a Super Click upgrade, which will then give them two points every time the button is clicked. The next Super Click upgrade will cost 22 points, and give them 3 points per click.
Upon getting 100 points, they can buy a click factory which gives them one point every ten seconds. The second click factory will cost them 150 points. The third will cost them 225 points (1.5 x 150).
